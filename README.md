# meteorlandings

![alt text](meteorlandings-q1project.firebaseapp.com)

This project is a web app designed to take in an address, gathers coordinates from Google geocode api, creates a coordinaterange, requests meteor landings within the range, and maps the coordinates with the name of the landing through Google Maps. To create this project I used html, css, sass, jquery, JSON, geoJSON, SoQL,  javascript and agile work philosophy.
